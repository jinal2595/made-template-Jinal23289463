## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
EEA_Climate change mitigation policies and measures_EUMMR_2020.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What is the effectiveness of EU climate change policies and mitigation strategies in achieving the goals set out in the European Environment Agency’s 2020 report?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The European Environment Agency’s 2020 report is used by this project to analyze EU climate change mitigation policies and initiatives. Our aim is to assess the effectiveness of these policies in mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions We will assess the EU’s progress towards climate change mitigation targets and identify the most effective strategies through data analysis on. This study will provide insightful information for those involved in policy making and climate change mitigation.
